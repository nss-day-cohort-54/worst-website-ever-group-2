                    It is a fashion, a way of life inspired by the very homeless 
                    vagrants that make this wonderful city so unique.
                    I invented the piano key neck tie! 
                    I invented it! I'm just a regular kid and want you to know the real truth 
                    about child labor laws, ok? They're silly and outdated. 
                    Why, back in the 30s, children as young as five 
                    could work as they pleased; from textile factories to iron smelts.

                You might be asking yourself "There is no way the piano key neck tie market can be profitable?"...dont you dare think such thoughts.
                  This sort of doubt only welcomes negative energy into your life.  The Great Mugatu gives you his assurances, the only thought in your
                   mind should be "Why didnt I begin selling these great neck ties sooner!?".  Well, your prayers are answered below, in the account set up and financing section.</p>

                <p><q>I finally tried it on the first cat. He will let anyone do anything to him. I had hoped that the
                        nervous cat would see the tolerant cat and both would be fine with it. Cat number 1 yelled and
                        hid in the closet. Cat number 2 went under the bed. Not yet willing to give up, I even tried it
                        on our dog. He tolerated it for about 2 minutes then grabbed it, took off, and buried it in the
                        back yard. All 3 animals were mad and avoided me for days. On top of everything else, my back
                        and neck hurt from using it. I really wanted this to be the next best thing, but it just
                        traumatized the animals. I hope that one of these days my cats and dog will love me again.</q>
