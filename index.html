                <p><q>I finally tried it on the first cat. He will let anyone do anything to him. I had hoped that the
                        nervous cat would see the tolerant cat and both would be fine with it. Cat number 1 yelled and
                        hid in the closet. Cat number 2 went under the bed. Not yet willing to give up, I even tried it
                        on our dog. He tolerated it for about 2 minutes then grabbed it, took off, and buried it in the
                        back yard. All 3 animals were mad and avoided me for days. On top of everything else, my back
                        and neck hurt from using it. I really wanted this to be the next best thing, but it just
                        traumatized the animals. I hope that one of these days my cats and dog will love me again.</q>

                <p><q>I've had plans for some time to go to the dark side, and was told by some loser I met at Chalmun's
                        Cantina that this jacket would be perfect because Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin both have a
                        weakness for men in black uniforms. Imagine my consternation when I discovered it only comes in
                        this yellow color and the metal doesn't even match! Luke can have it!</q>
