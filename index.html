                    It is a fashion, a way of life inspired by the very homeless 
                    vagrants that make this wonderful city so unique.
                    I invented the piano key neck tie! 
                    I invented it! I'm just a regular kid and want you to know the real truth 
                    about child labor laws, ok? They're silly and outdated. 
                    Why, back in the 30s, children as young as five 
                    could work as they pleased; from textile factories to iron smelts.
